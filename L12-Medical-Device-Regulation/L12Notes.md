## Device Regulation

**Before any medical device can be applied on patients it must be regulated to confirm its safety**

The relevant regulatory bodies:

* UK: MHRA
* US: FDA

Getting approval for a biomedical device is quite a laborious [procedure](#deviceprocedure).

This procedure is very thorough and requires a lot of technical documentation, explaining how it works, it needs significant testing to prove that it's safe to the regulators. However this doesn't end once you've got the approval, you still need to have a quality management system in place as they will be constantly monitoring the process of making the devices, it will be routinely investigated.

### Medical Device Definition

> A 'Medical Device' means any instrument apparatus, appliance, material or other article, whether used alone or in combination, including software necessary for its proper application intended by the manufacturer to be used for human beings for the purpose of:
> * diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease
> * Diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of or compensation for an injury or handicap
> * investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological process
> * Control of conception
>
> and which does not achieve its principle intended action in or on the human body by pharamacological, immunological or metabolic means, but which may be assisted in its function by such means;

```{note} Note!

The last part is there to differentiate medical devices from drugs

```

#### Active Medical Device

> ’Active medical device' means	any	medical	device relying for its functioning on a	source of electrical energy	or any source of power other than that directly	generated by the human body	or gravity;

> ’Active implantable medical device' means	any	active medical device which is intended to be totally or partially introduced, surgically or medically, into the human body or by medical intervention into a natural orifice, and which is intended to remain after this procedure

#### In Vitro Diagnostic

> "in vitro diagnostic medical device" means any medical device which is a reagent, reagent product, calibrator, control material, kit, instrument, apparatus, equipment, or system, whether used alone or in combination, intended by the manufacturer to be used in vitro for the examination of specimens, including blood and tissue donations, derived from the human body, solely or principally for the purpose of providing information:
> * Concerning a physiological or pathological state, or
> * Concerning a congenital abnormality, or
> * Determine the safety and compatibility with potential recipients, or
> * To monitor therapeutic measures..."

### Classes - MHRA

We classify the aforementioned device types in 4 classes.

```

* Class	I	
    * generally	regarded as	low	risk		
    * Example:	Hearing	aid
* Class	II	a	
    * generally	regarded	as	medium	risk		
    * Example:	Continuous	glucose	monitors
* Class	II	b	
    * generally	regarded as	medium risk	(can potentially be harmful)	
    * Example:	Artificial	Pancreas, ECG
* Class	III	
    * generally	regarded as	high risk (implantable)	
    * Example:	Pacemaker, hip replacement

### The Rules (UK)

• **Competent	Authority	(UK	Bulleetin No. 10):	THE	RULES**
• Rules	1-4	- non-invasive devices	
• Rules	5-8	- invasive devices	
• Rules	9-12 - additional Rules	applicable	to	active	devices	
• Rules	13-18 -	miscellaneous Rules	for	products which merit a higher classification than they might otherwise be assigned
