## Bio-signals

All types of signals that can be measured in relation with the human body and its physiology, we will look a bit at the classifications of biosignals

### Electrical

Electrical biosignals usually measure biopotentials and impedance, for example:

* <span style="color:red">Electroenecephalogram (EEG)</span> - measures electrical activity of brain, electrodes placed on scalp and record tiny electrical impulses produced by neural activity
* <span style="color:red">Electrocardiogram (ECG)</span> - records the electrical signals generated by the heart as it beats, electrodes placed on the skin of chest, arms, legs (usually 12 leads)
* <span style="color:red">Electromyogram (EMG)</span> - measures electrical activity of muscles during rest and contraction, again electrodes on skin above muscle
* <span style="color:red">Galvanic skin response (GSR)</span> - measures changes in electrical conductance of the skin, which varies with moisture level, can measure changes in sweat gland activity influenced by the ANS
* <span style="color:red">Electrical Impedance tomography (EIT)</span> - A medical imaging technique that produces images based on electrical conductivity distribution on body, small electrical currents are applied via electrodes around region of interest and voltage responses are measured

```{note} Note

Generally the further away the source of signal is from the measuring component, the lower the frequency and strength of measured signal. This is something that we must consider when developing devices.

### Chemical

This includes things like concentration of things, such as blood glucose

### Mechanical

This is mostly measured externally but can also be internal including things such as:

* Pressure (blood for example)
* Temperature (body for example)
* Flow
* Velocity
* Acceleration
* Force
* etc

### Imaging

This includes methods such as ultra-sound, X-ray, MRI, etc

## Electric signals in  living organisms: where do they come from?

More or less all cells have electrical potential -> For some cells this is essential for functionality of those cells.


### Structural and functional organisation of the human body

Firstly lets cover the basic fundamental organisation of biological organisms

1. <span style="color:red"> Cells </span> - fundamental units of a living body, the smallest anatomical and physiological unit of the human body that can live and reproduce on its own

2. <span style="color:red"> Tissues </span> - a group of cells (and surrounding substances) that function together to perform some function(s). The four primary types of tissue:
    * muscle
    * nervous
    * epithelial (skin, intestines)
    * connective (e.g bone, cartilage, ligaments, tendons, etc)

3. <span style="color:red"> Organs </span> - combination of tissues that perform complex tasks (e.g kidneys, liver, heart, etc)

4. <span style="color:red"> Systems </span> - there are 11 major organ systems: muscular, skeletal, nervous, respiratory, circulatory, reporductive, digistive, urinary, endocrine, lymphatic, integumentary (skin, hair, nails, etc)

### Cells and the cell membrane

The cell membrane is fundamental to the existence of living organisms as we know them. The idea that cells can regulate and compartmentalise themselves and separate themselves from their environment while retaining a structural integrity enables much of the functionality we attribute to living organisms.

The formation of cells and the cell membrane is spontaneous. This is because of **phospholipids**, which spontaneously form a bilayer when in an aqueous environment.

```{hint} What are phospholipids?
:class: dropdown

Phospholipids are a type of lipid molecule that consists of 3 main components:

1. **Glycerol Backbone**: The core of the molecule connecting the different marts
2. **Phosphate Group**: Attached to the glycerol backbone, making one end of the molecule hydrophilic (water-loving)
3. **Fatty Acid Tails**: Two long chains of hydrocarbons that are hydrophobic (water repelling, or not attracting)

Each phospholipid has a **polar (hydrophillic) head** that includes the phosphate group and a **nonpolar (hydrophobic) tail** made of fatty acids. This dual nature is curcial for the formation of the cell membrane.

```

The polar heads and nonpolar tails create a dual nature or amphipathic property, causing the membrane to have very high impedance (M$\Omega$). This provides cells with a **selective permeability**, only allowing certain molecules to pass through and reject others:

* Oxygen ✅
* Carbon Dioxide ✅
* Ethanol ✅
* water-soluble molecules ❌
* ions ❌
* water itself ❌

✅ = can pass via passive diffusion
❌ = cannot pass via passive diffusion

**Therefore specific transport protiens are required in order to allow for useful ions to enter the cell, these take the form of transport channels / enzymes** 

### Potassium and Sodium Ion Channels (Na/K Pump)
