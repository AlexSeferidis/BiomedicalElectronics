## Bio-signals

All types of signals that can be measured in relation with the human body and its physiology, we will look a bit at the classifications of biosignals

### Electrical

Electrical biosignals usually measure biopotentials and impedance, for example:

* <span style="color:red">Electroenecephalogram (EEG)</span> - measures electrical activity of brain, electrodes placed on scalp and record tiny electrical impulses produced by neural activity
* <span style="color:red">Electrocardiogram (ECG)</span> - records the electrical signals generated by the heart as it beats, electrodes placed on the skin of chest, arms, legs (usually 12 leads)
* <span style="color:red">Electromyogram (EMG)</span> - measures electrical activity of muscles during rest and contraction, again electrodes on skin above muscle
* <span style="color:red">Galvanic skin response (GSR)</span> - measures changes in electrical conductance of the skin, which varies with moisture level, can measure changes in sweat gland activity influenced by the ANS
* <span style="color:red">Electrical Impedance tomography (EIT)</span> - A medical imaging technique that produces images based on electrical conductivity distribution on body, small electrical currents are applied via electrodes around region of interest and voltage responses are measured

```{note} Note

Generally the further away the source of signal is from the measuring component, the lower the frequency and strength of measured signal. This is something that we must consider when developing devices.
```

### Chemical

This includes things like concentration of things, such as blood glucose

### Mechanical

This is mostly measured externally but can also be internal including things such as:

* Pressure (blood for example)
* Temperature (body for example)
* Flow
* Velocity
* Acceleration
* Force
* etc

### Imaging

This includes methods such as ultra-sound, X-ray, MRI, etc

## Electric signals in  living organisms: where do they come from?

More or less all cells have electrical potential -> For some cells this is essential for functionality of those cells.


### Structural and functional organisation of the human body

Firstly lets cover the basic fundamental organisation of biological organisms

1. <span style="color:red"> Cells </span> - fundamental units of a living body, the smallest anatomical and physiological unit of the human body that can live and reproduce on its own

2. <span style="color:red"> Tissues </span> - a group of cells (and surrounding substances) that function together to perform some function(s). The four primary types of tissue:
    * muscle
    * nervous
    * epithelial (skin, intestines)
    * connective (e.g bone, cartilage, ligaments, tendons, etc)

3. <span style="color:red"> Organs </span> - combination of tissues that perform complex tasks (e.g kidneys, liver, heart, etc)

4. <span style="color:red"> Systems </span> - there are 11 major organ systems: muscular, skeletal, nervous, respiratory, circulatory, reporductive, digistive, urinary, endocrine, lymphatic, integumentary (skin, hair, nails, etc)

### Cells and the cell membrane

The cell membrane is fundamental to the existence of living organisms as we know them. The idea that cells can regulate and compartmentalise themselves and separate themselves from their environment while retaining a structural integrity enables much of the functionality we attribute to living organisms.

The formation of cells and the cell membrane is spontaneous. This is because of **phospholipids**, which spontaneously form a bilayer when in an aqueous environment.

```{hint} What are phospholipids?
:class: dropdown

Phospholipids are a type of lipid molecule that consists of 3 main components:

1. **Glycerol Backbone**: The core of the molecule connecting the different marts
2. **Phosphate Group**: Attached to the glycerol backbone, making one end of the molecule hydrophilic (water-loving)
3. **Fatty Acid Tails**: Two long chains of hydrocarbons that are hydrophobic (water repelling, or not attracting)

Each phospholipid has a **polar (hydrophillic) head** that includes the phosphate group and a **nonpolar (hydrophobic) tail** made of fatty acids. This dual nature is curcial for the formation of the cell membrane.

```

```{figure} ..\Images\L2\cellstruc.png
:label: cellmem
:alt: Cell and Cell Membrane Diagram
:align: center
```

The polar heads and nonpolar tails create a dual nature or amphipathic property, causing the membrane to have very high impedance (M$\Omega$). This provides cells with a **selective permeability**, only allowing certain molecules to pass through and reject others:

* Oxygen ✅
* Carbon Dioxide ✅
* Ethanol ✅
* water-soluble molecules ❌
* ions ❌
* water itself ❌

✅ = can pass via passive diffusion
❌ = cannot pass via passive diffusion

**Therefore specific transport protiens are required in order to allow for useful ions to enter the cell, these take the form of transport channels / enzymes** 

### Potassium and Sodium Ion Channels (Na/K Pump)

Ion channels are proteins embedded in the cell membrane that create pathways for specific ions, such as sodium, potassium, calcium and chlorine to move in and out of cells.

```{figure} ..\Images\L2\nak.png
:label: ionchannel
:alt: PotassiumSodiumIonChannels
:align: center
```

These channels (as seen [here](#ionchannel)) are highly selective, typically only choosing one type of ion to pass through them and can either be gated or leak channels.

**So how do ion channels generate currents?**

1. **Resting Membrane Potential**

    * Cells (especially neurons and muscle cells) maintain a difference in electric potential between the inside and outside of the cell membrane called the **resting membrane potential**.

    * This potential exists because of differences in ion concentrations across the membrane and the selective permeability of the membrane caused by the ion pumps

2. **Ion Movement**

    * Ion channels allow specific ions to diffuse (high to low concentration) toward their opposite charges, e.g sodium ions (+ve charged) will naturally move towards the negative interior of a cell when channels open

    * When an ion channel opens, ions can move across the cell membrane, this movement of charged particles creates a current

```{hint} Types of Ion Channels
:class: dropdown

* **Voltage-gated channels**: These open in response to changes in membrane potential. When a specific voltage threshold is reached, the channels open, allowing ions to flow and create a current.

* **Ligand-gated channels**: These open when a specific molecule (ligand), such as a neurotransmitter, binds to them, allowing ions to flow and generate current.

The opening and closing of these channels are tightly regulated, which in turn controls the timing and amplitude of the current produced.
```

### Transport Processes

What forces things to move?

```{figure} ..\Images\L2\transportproc.png
:label: trans
:alt: Transport Processes
:align: center
```

This brings us to the **Nernst equation** (see [here](#nernst)), which relates the concentration gradient of an ion across a membrane to the electric potential at which that ion will be at equilibrium, deriving from:

```{math}
\text{Diffusion current } = \text{ drift current}
```

We get the following equation:

```{math}
:label: nernst
V_k = -\frac{RT}{z_{k}F}ln(\frac{c_{i,k}}{c_{o,k}})
```

Where:

* $V_k$ is the **equilibrium potential** for the ion, in volts (V)
* $R$ is the **universal gas constant**, equal to 8.314 J/(mol * K)
* $T$ is the **temperature**, in Kelvin (K)
* $z_k$ is the **valence** (charge) of the ion
* $F$ is the **Faraday constant** which is approximately 96'485 C/mol
* $c_{i,k}$ and $c_{o,k}$ represent the *concentrations** of the ion inside and outside the cell

## Neural Signalling and Communication

Let's discuss how what we've now learnt relates to how the cells in our brain communicate with each other

### The Neuron

A diagram of a neuron can be seen [here](#neuron)

```{figure} ..\Images\L2\neurondiagram.png
:label: neuron
:alt: Diagram of a Neuron
:align: center
```

Let's focus on the most important parts:

TO DO

### Transmission

In order to explain how neural signalling works we will look at a **very important** [graph](#action). This describes the **action potential** of a neuron, which is an electric signal that travels along the axon of a neuron.

```{figure} ..\Images\L2\actionpoten.png
:label: action
:alt: Action Potential Graph
:align: center
```

1. **Resting Membrane Potential**

    * Before an action potential can occur, a neuron maintains a **resting membrane potential** of approximately **-70 mV**
    * This is maintained due to **potassium** leak channels, allowing potassium ions to move out of the neuron and **sodium-potassium pumps** which actively transports 3 sodium ions out of the cell and 2 potassium ions in using ATP

2. **Depolarisation**

    * The action potential is triggered when the **membrane potential** of a neuron becomes more positive, reaching a threshold of about **-50 mV**
    * This causes the **voltage-gated sodium channels** to open, causing sodium ions to rush into the cell
    * This causes the inside of the cell to become much more +ve (as Na+), resulting in depolarisation causing a spike of up to **+40 mV**

3. **Peak**

    * At the peak of the action potential the **voltage-gated sodium channels** start to **inactivate**, preventing further influx of sodium ions

4. **Repolarisation**

    * To bring the membrane potential back down, **voltage-gated potassium channels** open, these open slower than the sodium channels and therefore activate just as the sodium channels inactivate.
    * As potassium ions now leave the cell, it causes the membrane potential to become more negative (as K+)

5. **Refractory Period / Hyperpolarisation**

    * The potassium channels do not close immediately after reaching the resting potential, as a result the membrane potential often becomes more negative than the resting potential
    * And after it returns to the resting membrane potential

```{figure} ..\Images\L2\synapse.png
:label: syn
:alt: synapse
:align: center
```

6. **Synapse**

    * Once the action potential has travelled along the axon and reaches the **presynaptic terminal** a similar process occurs
    * depolarisation causes **voltage-gated calcium channels** to activate
    * This in turn triggers the release of neurotransmitters allowing for the synaptic current to occur (which is a chemical process)

## The Nervous System

Zooming out now we can see how this kind of behavior can impact our whole body and system.

```{figure} ..\Images\L2\nervous.png
:label: ner
:alt: Nervous system
:align: center
```

From [this image](#ner) we can see that the Nervous System, dictated by signals and current that we previously discussed, is responsible for A LOT. It is divided between the CNS and PNS and takes up the responsibilities of:

* **Sensing the Environment**: It detects changes inside and outside the body using sensory receptors (e.g., light, sound, temperature, pressure).
* **Processing Information**: It interprets and integrates sensory information in the brain to make sense of what's happening.
* **Initiating Responses**: It sends signals to muscles and glands to respond to sensory input. This includes voluntary actions, like moving an arm, and involuntary actions, like increasing heart rate.

You can see how important electronics can be therefore with neurological disorders

## Typical Biopotentials (EEG, ECG, etc)

EEG measures the brain’s electrical activity from the scalp from the activity of billions of neurons. ECG measures galvanically the electrical activity of the heart.

We can see how these signals can range:

| Signal | Amplitude (mV) | Bandwidth (Hz) |
| :----: | :------------: | :------------: |
| EEG    | 0.001-0.01     | 0.5-40         |
| ECG    | 1-5            | 0.05-100       |

```{figure} ..\Images\L2\ranges.png
:label: rng
:alt: Ranges of different Biopotentials
:align: center
```

And obviously these can range due to [a number of factors](#systemcon)

```{warning} WARNING!!
Make sure you remember these ranges and frequencies!!!
```
## Summary

* The body generates a lot of electrical/physical/chemical
signals which give off important information we need to
detect to either help monitor, diagnose or treat a medical
condition.
* These originate from chemical, bio-physical processes.
* Electronic instrumentation is vital in detecting these signals.
* Proper interfacing with signals of biological origin is still a very
challenging task !
